```

**Prerequisites**:

- Node Version 19+ (<https://nodejs.org/en>)

- Recaster App (<https://recaster.org>)

- Ngrok Account (<https://ngrok.com/>)

- Neynar API Key (<https://dev.neynar.com/app>)

- Any IDE - e.g., Visual Studio Code or Cursor

- **DO NOT FORGET** - your domain MUST be allow-listed by Warpcast to be sharable

- NextAuth does NOT work on [localhost](http://localhost) - use Ngrok or another platform for testing.

---

**How to run**

Set up your `.env.local` file with the correct environment variables.

```
# ngrok url [https://ngrok.com/]
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=
# ngrok short url ( no https:// )
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL_SHORT=

# NextAuth secret (generate a new one for production)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=760...

# Neynar API key (get one at https://neynar.com/)
NEYNAR_API_KEY=NEYNAR_API_DOCS

# Next.js environment  (Only effects logging atm)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development

# Auth encryption key (generate a new one for production)
AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY=you-should-generate-a-new-key

# Your app name - used for frame api routes and meta tags - must be 15 characters or less
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME= 'Sample Mini App'

# Your apps full descritpion
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DESCRIPTION= 'Sample Mini App Description'

# Your apps short descritpion - must be 20 characters or less
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DESCRIPTION_SHORT= 'Sample App'
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

This will display a QR code that you can scan with Recaster (mobile) or open in Warpcast Playground (desktop) to test the Mini App.

### Overview

In this demo boilerplate, we will discuss how to set up a basic flow to allow Mini Apps (composer actions) to work with Next.js NextAuth system. We will refer to the composer actions as Mini Apps.

Farcaster Mini Apps are web apps that can be embedded into any Farcaster client.

When accessed from a Farcaster client, Mini Apps can currently access the following features:

- Magic link style authentication
- Create Cast intent - share frames, contextual information, etc
- Deeplinking - easily prompt Mini app from feed, dms, external shares etc
- Transactions - **COMING SOON** - prompt transactions from within the mini app

This boilerplate is a simple example of how to create a Farcaster Mini App as quickly as possible.

- Mini apps can be built with any web framework, but for this example we will use Next.js
- We will use NextAuth for managing authentication credentials
- We will create an api route to handle launching the mini app and authenticating users from a Farcaster client
- We will handle the session state for the mini app with NextAuth session and custom session provider
- We will use the `createCast` method to create a new cast intent from within the mini app

### Firstly

Create a `.env.local` file and populate it with all the environment variables (envs) from the `.env.example` file.

All of the envs must be filled out for the Mini App to work

Test your Mini App to ensure it works with Farcaster:

**Mobile:** <https://recaster.org> **Desktop:** [https://warpcast.com/\\\~/developers/composer-actions](https://warpcast.com/%5C~/developers/composer-actions)

In the Composer Action Playground, don't forget to add `/api/launcher` at the end of the Post URL, like in the example below:

<https://www.yourUrl.xyz/api/launcher>

**Live Demo**

You can view a sample demo [here](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/composer-actions?postUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmini-app-next-js-boilerplate.vercel.app%2Fapi%2Flauncher) to see how this boilerplate works with a Farcaster client infrastructure using an embedded web view.

### Mini App Launch Flow

When your Mini App is triggered by a Farcaster client, it calls the `api/launcher` route with an authenticated post request from the user.

In the `api/launcher` route, we extract the `messageBytes` from the `trustedData` provided by the Farcaster client. We then validate the `messageBytes` using Neynar APIs. Upon successful validation, we use the same `messageBytes` to create a URL needed for the Farcaster client to redirect to.

We encrypt the `messageBytes` using a standard AES encryption method. The encrypted `messageBytes` are URL-encoded by replacing certain characters to avoid creating an invalid link. The auth link will look something like this:

`https://YOUR_DOMAIN.xyz/auth?key=ABCD....XYZ&mini=true`

The Farcaster Client will use this link to open the Mini App in an embedded web view.

When the mini app opens, the URL contains the `key`, which is essential for the frontend. As the Mini App loads, the `AuthContext.tsx` detects the `key`.

```
const scheduling = async (key: string) => {
      await handleSignIn(key)
      router.replace(pathname)
}

useEffect(() => {
      const key = searchParams.get("key")
      const mini = searchParams.get("mini")

      if (key) {
            // If key is detected fire scheduling() - so it can fire handleSignIn()
            // We do it this way, as the URL wants to be replaced after login to clear it from all params
            scheduling(key)
      }
      if (mini) {
            setIsMini(true)
      }
}, [handleSignIn, searchParams])
```

When the `key` is detected, we call the `handleSignIn` function. This function calls the `auth/[...nextAuth]` authentication using the `miniApp` method.

In `[...nextAuth]/authOptions`, we first use the correct `CredentialsProvider` based on the `id` that was called. We then ensure that all necessary parameters are received. Next, we decrypt the `key` and revert the replaced special characters back to their original state (which were replaced back in `api/launcher`).

Using the `key`, we `validateFrameAction` which on success retrieves the user. With this user data, we construct a user object that can safely be passed to the frontend via `session`.

Additionally, we return `cipheredParams`, an encrypted user object that communicates with the backend securely to prevent injection attacks.

### QR Code Login Option \[Standard SIWF\]

There’s also the option to log in via a QR code.

When a user accesses the Mini App outside of a Farcaster client, there will be no `key`.

The user will need to authenticate using a QR code. The user is directed to the `/auth` page, where they are prompted with the `SIFC.tsx` Sign-In Modal Component. When clicked, a scannable QR code appears. Once scanned, it calls the `auth/[...nextAuth]` authentication, this time using the `farcasterQR` method.

This method is similar to the previous one but instead of using `validateFrameAction`, it uses the `verifySignInMessage` method from the Neynar SDK, as it receives a `message` and `signature` from the QR code data, and verifies their authenticity.
